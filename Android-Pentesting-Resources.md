### Tools
These tools are mostly used by "penetration-tester's" world wide. Many of these tools need java to work properly.

| Tools | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| [`apktool`](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/) | A tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It also makes working with an app easier because of the project like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. |
| [`jadx`](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) | Dex to Java decompiler. Command line and GUI tools for producing Java source code from Android Dex and Apk files |
| [`dex2jar`](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar) | dex2jar contains following components: `dex-reader` is designed to read the Dalvik Executable (.dex/.odex) format. It has a light weight API similar with ASM. `dex-translator` is designed to do the convert job. It reads the dex instruction to dex-ir format, after some optimize, convert to ASM format. `dex-ir` used by dex-translator, is designed to represent the dex instruction. `dex-tools` tools to work with .class files. here are examples: Modify a apk, DeObfuscate a jar. `d2j-smali` disassemble dex to smali files and assemble dex from smali files. different implementation to smali/baksmali, same syntax, but we support escape in type desc “Lcom/dex2jar\t\u1234;”. `dex-writer` write dex same way as dex-reader |
| [`adb`](https://en.droidwiki.org/wiki/Android_Debug_Bridge) | Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device |
| [`dnSpy`](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) | dnSpy is a debugger and .NET assembly editor. You can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you don't have any source code available. |
| [`bettercap`](https://www.bettercap.org/legacy/index.html) | BetterCAP is a powerful, flexible and portable tool** created to perform various types of MITM attacks against a network, manipulate HTTP, HTTPS and TCP traffic in realtime, sniff for credentials and much more. |
| [`BurpSuite`](https://portswigger.net/burp) | Burp Suite is the choice of security professionals worldwide. Automated, scalable web vulnerability scanning. |
| [`enjarify`](https://github.com/google/enjarify) | Enjarify is a tool for translating Dalvik bytecode to equivalent Java bytecode. This allows Java analysis tools to analyze Android applications. |
| [`apkleaks`](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks) | Scanning APK file for URIs, endpoints & secrets. |
| [`nuclei`](https://github.com/optiv/mobile-nuclei-templates) | Nuclei is used to send requests across targets based on a template leading to zero false positives and providing fast scanning on large number of hosts. Nuclei offers scanning for a variety of protocols including TCP, DNS, HTTP, File, etc. With powerful and flexible templating, all kinds of security checks can be modelled with Nuclei. |
| [`csploit`](https://www.csploit.org/) |  Advanced IT security professional toolkit on Android featuring an integrated Metasploit daemon and MITM capabilities.|
| [`fing-app`](https://www.fing.com/products/fing-app/) | Network scanning and host enumeration app that performs NetBIOS, UPnP, Bonjour, SNMP, and various other advanced device fingerprinting techniques |
| [`qark`](https://github.com/linkedin/qark/) | This tool is designed to look for several security related Android application vulnerabilities, either in source code or packaged APKs. The tool is also capable of creating "Proof-of-Concept" deployable APKs and/or ADB commands, capable of exploiting many of the vulnerabilities it finds. There is no need to root the test device, as this tool focuses on vulnerabilities that can be exploited under otherwise secure conditions. |
| [`AndroBugs`](https://github.com/AndroBugs/AndroBugs_Framework) | AndroBugs Framework is an Android vulnerability analysis system that helps developers or hackers find potential security vulnerabilities in Android applications. No splendid GUI interface, but the most efficient (less than 2 minutes per scan in average) and more accurate. |
| [`MobSF`](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) | Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. |
| [`JAADAS`](https://github.com/flankerhqd/JAADAS) | This is Joint Advanced Defect Assessment framework for android applications (JAADS, original name JADE renamed to avoid potential trademark issue), written in 2014. JAADAS is a tool written in Java and Scala with the power of Soot to provide both interprocedure and intraprocedure static analysis for android applications. Its features include API misuse analysis, local-denial-of-service (intent crash) analysis, inter-procedure style taint flow analysis (from intent to sensitive API, i.e. getting a parcelable from intent, and use it to start activity). |
| [`Bevigil`](https://bevigil.com/) | _BeVigil_ is a free mobile application security testing tool. Identify vulnerabilities or secrets in apps by deep analysis using android app scanner. |
| [`FSquaDRA`](https://github.com/zyrikby/FSquaDRA) | FSquaDRA is a tool for detection of repackaged Android applications. The approach is based on the idea that repackaged applications want to maintain "look and feel" of the originals. |
| [`Introspy-Android`](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Introspy-Android) | Introspy-Android comprises two separate components: a GUI interface to configure hooks, filters and options and a Cydia Substrate extension containing the core of the tool functionalities, including hooks and analysis of potential issues. |
| [`frida`](https://frida.re/) | Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers. |
| [`MARA`](https://github.com/xtiankisutsa/MARA_Framework) | MARA is a Mobile Application Reverse engineering and Analysis Framework. It is a toolkit that puts together commonly used mobile application reverse engineering and analysis tools to assist in testing mobile applications against the OWASP mobile security threats. |
| [`droidbox`](https://github.com/pjlantz/droidbox) | DroidBox is developed to offer dynamic analysis of Android applications. |
